# DSA Problem Note – 2026-01-17

**Problem Name / Source:**  
https://www.structy.net/problems/max-value

**Problem Statement (Original):**  
Write a function, max_value, that takes in list of numbers as an argument. The function should return the largest number in the list.

Solve this without using any built-in list methods.

You can assume that the list is non-empty.

**Restated Problem (Your Words):**  
Input:  list of numbers
Output:  largest value (single digit)

Givens:
- function name: max_value
- The list will not be empty.

**Classification:**  
- Domain / Problem Context:  Arrays
- Type / Pattern:  Linear Scan
- Input Characteristics: <!-- Size, Sorted/Unsorted, Duplicates allowed?, Range, Negative numbers -->  
- Expected Output: <!-- Single value, Collection, Boolean, Subsequence -->

**Scope:**  
<!-- Interview-style → correctness + Big O, Production-style → validation + robustness -->

**Scale:**  
- Single machine?  
- Runs in memory?

**Queries:**  
- One query or Many queries?  
- Offline or Online?

**Constraints:**  
- Can input be mutated?  
- Pure function?  
- Concurrency?

**Performance Goal:**  
<!-- Latency vs Throughput -->

**Complexity Gate:**  
<!-- Expected n → algorithm class -->

**Edge Case Sweep:**  
- Empty  
- Single  
- Duplicates  
- Extremes  
- Worst ordering

**Clarifying Questions & Assumptions:**  
<!-- Questions you would ask before coding, assumptions you are making -->

**Outline Solution (Verbal / Pseudocode):**  
<!-- Only now outline the approach; no full code yet -->

**Notes / Reflections:**  

<!-- Optional: insights, mistakes, patterns noticed, lessons learned -->
