| Category                     | Clarifying Questions (Ask if it affects approach)                                               | If Confirmed → Constraint          | If Unconfirmed → Assumption        | Why It Matters                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Problem Intent**           | What exactly needs to be returned? Any solution or all?                                         | Defines success criteria           | Proceed with stated interpretation | Prevents solving the wrong problem         |
| **Input Guarantees**         | Can input be empty? Always a valid answer? Duplicates allowed? Values bounded? Negative values? | Hard rules you can rely on         | Reasonable defaults you state      | Determines edge cases and algorithm safety |
| **Ordering / Structure**     | Is input sorted? Is order meaningful? Cyclic or acyclic? Sequence, set, tree, graph?            | Enables specific patterns          | Tentative classification           | Determines which algorithms are valid      |
| **Mutability**               | Can I modify the input? Must preserve order? Pure function?                                     | In-place or immutable requirement  | Assume no mutation if unclear      | Affects space complexity and design        |
| **Query Pattern**            | One query or many? Same input reused? Preprocessing allowed?                                    | Justifies preprocessing or caching | Assume single query                | Changes time vs space tradeoffs            |
| **Performance Expectations** | Target time or space? Worst-case required?                                                      | Optimization target is fixed       | Default to efficient Big-O         | Prevents over- or under-engineering        |
| **Scale & Environment**      | Single machine? Fits in memory? Concurrency concerns?                                           | System-level constraints           | Assume single-threaded, in-memory  | Rules out invalid assumptions              |
| **Edge Behavior**            | What edge cases matter? Empty, single, duplicates, extremes?                                    | Must be handled explicitly         | Default sweep                      | Ensures correctness                        |
